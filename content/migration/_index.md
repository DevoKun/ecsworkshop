# Migrating workloads to ECS

In this chapter we are going to walk through a migration of an API service running on a virtual machine using Amazon EC2 to Amazon ECS. 
The API service is a REST API written in Python that talks to a backend database using DynamoDB.
The goal of this workshop is to simulate the experience of migrating an application to a container and gain a better understanding of the steps involved when making the transition.
On that note, let's get right into it.
