AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store consists of standard and advanced parameters. Standard parameters are available at no additional charge. When you create advanced parameters, you are charged based on the number of advanced parameters stored each month and per API interaction. Charges for parameters stored for less than a month are prorated on an hourly basis.
